There are few things in design that are more subjective than the use of color. A color that can evoke one reaction in one person may stimulate the opposite reaction in another, due to culture, prior association, or even just personal preference.

Here are a few things that can have an impact on the meaning of colors:

- **Cultural differences**—Red represents good luck in China but in South Africa it’s the color of mourning. Americans associate green with money as that’s the color of dollar bills but that isn’t the case globally. Black is the color of mourning in Western countries, while in some East Asian countries it’s white. In the US green is the color of envy, while in Germany it’s yellow. You’ll need to be sensitive to these differences depending on where you are operating.
- **Time**—Colors may also change in significance over time: red used to be seen as a strong, masculine color while blue was a feminine color suited for girls.
- **Shades and tones**—A color may have a general meaning, but lighter shades can vary dramatically compared to darker shades, while more natural, muted shades will differ from artificial neon colors. Make sure that you look at the specific associations of the different shades and tones. For example, if you’re using neon green, don’t assume that just because you’ve chosen a shade of green it’s going to be a good fit for an eco-friendly brand. Similarly, a bright magenta will have a totally different meaning from a muted pastel shade of rosé, even if they are both shades of pink.

Now let’s explore what all those colors mean…
